# Sleepy Time Soaps

## DEPRECATED
This code is no longer utilized. All existing keys and database references no longer exist. They are left as placeholder for anyone interested in utilizing the repository as a template. 

This code is not commented, as a variety of the comments pertained only to the infrastructure that was being built at the time. If asked, I can easily go through and comment the code for future readers.

## Design and Development
This is a website designed for my wife's soap-making business. It has since been depricated in favor of a more modular system integrated directly with payment processing API's through 'Shop'.

The website is built and developed using ASP.NET Framework on the back-end and a variety of JS and CSS libraries on the front-end. It was, at the time, fully capable of processing payment utilizing the Square payment API and integrated directly with the hosting service provider we had chosen to use at the time.

If anyone stumbles on this project in the future, please feel free to utilize it as a template for website design using ASP.NET
